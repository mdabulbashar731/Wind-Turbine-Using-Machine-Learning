# Wind-Turbine-Using-Machine-Learning
The globe has started to pay more attention to wind speed/power because of its renewable nature and positive environmental consequences. As the installed wind power capacity in the world quickly rises, the wind business is growing to be a sig- nificant one. Reliable machine, wind speed estimates are essential for wind energy conversion systems, just as they are for the took the decision of wind turbines and the scheduling of power systems. An accurate cast is needed to address the problems of varying energy product caused by shifting rainfall conditions. The speed of the wind has a significant impact on how much power it produces. Throughout a certain time span, wind speed displays a recurrent pattern despite being largely non-linear. We take use of this time series tendency to learn more.
