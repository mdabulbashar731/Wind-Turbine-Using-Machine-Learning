# Wind-Turbine-Using-Machine-Learning
The globe has started to pay more attention to wind speed/power because of its renewable nature and positive environmental consequences. As the installed wind power capacity in the world quickly rises, the wind business is growing to be a sig- nificant one. Reliable machine, wind speed estimates are essential for wind energy conversion systems, just as they are for the took the decision of wind turbines and the scheduling of power systems. An accurate cast is needed to address the problems of varying energy product caused by shifting rainfall conditions. The speed of the wind has a significant impact on how much power it produces. Throughout a certain time span, wind speed displays a recurrent pattern despite being largely non-linear. We take use of this time series tendency to learn more.
# Data Processing
Data pre-processing was required to create a table of rainfall and energy measure- ments recorded at identical intervals in order to execute data modeling and variable selection on the gathered data.   When the amount of rainfall is measured,  the en- ergy usage of the ranch is measured at a rate of 5 twinkles per hour, including the time prints of 0 and 30 twinkles every hour. In order to tie rainfall measurements to ranch energy averages provided at intervals of 0 and 25 and 55 nanoseconds every hour, respectively, was our strategy. While using all available energy data, compa- rable averaging makes modeling more sensitive. The Date List function in Wolfram Mathematical 8 was used to automatically convert the various time scales utilized in the rainfall and energy data to one scale.
# 	Problem Statement
Depending on the situation, the problem statement for a wind turbine may change, but in general, it entails creating, maintaining, and using a wind turbine that can effectively and consistently produce electricity from wind energy.
The following are a few examples of specific difficulties that could be listed in the problem statement for a wind turbine project:
Optimizing energy output: Wind turbines must be built to efficiently catch and transform wind energy into electricity. This may entail adjusting the location and direction of the turbine itself as well as the size and shape of the turbine blades.
Durability and dependability: Wind turbines must be able to survive a variety of climatic factors, including strong winds and chilly temperatures.
# 		Objective
In this project, we aimed to develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast the energy output of a wind turbine based on weather conditions. The objectives of the projects are:
•	To collect and analyze weather data from various sources, including tempera- ture, humidity, wind speed, and direction, and use this data to train a machine learning model.
•	To develop a predictive model that uses machine learning algorithms, such as regression or neural networks, to forecast the energy output of a wind turbine based on weather conditions.
•	To validate the accuracy of the machine learning model by comparing its fore- casts to actual energy output data from wind turbines.
This is crucial since the generation of wind energy can be quite unpredictable and weather-dependent, making it challenging to incorporate into the electrical grid and plan for energy supply. It is feasible to create models that can accurately anticipate the energy output of wind turbines by analyzing historical data on wind speeds, wind directions, temperatures, and other weather variables using machine learning techniques.
# 		Objective
Then, one may wonder why not, as wind energy may be used in a variety of indus- tries, including the production of energy for future generations. But, the constraint prevents us from using the wind’s energy. These restrictions are as follows:
•	Because the wind can only move at a certain speed, the kinetic energy of the wind is decreased.
 
•	The wind’s velocity varies. Thus, the inconsistent speed is not suited for ob- taining steady energy. There is no way to regulate it.
•	It takes a long time to produce a considerable amount of wind energy, making it a long-term process.
•	We need a lot of space to build wind turbine in order to create wind energy. consuming a substantial.
#  	Limitation
It is challenging to anticipate how much power a wind turbine will produce since wind speed and direction can change significantly over brief periods of time.
The design of the blades, the diameter of the rotor, and the size of the generator all have an impact on how efficient a wind turbine is. Numerous factors may have an impact on the quantity of power that can be generated at a given wind speed.
The quantity of electricity that may be generated can also be influenced by the wind turbine’s position. The topography, structures, and plants, as well as the wind’s direction and speed, can have an influence on the power production.
Accurate wind speed and other meteorological data collection can be challenging, particularly in distant areas. The performance of a wind turbine can be difficult to predict with such few data.
Collecting precise wind speed and other meteorological data can be difficult, espe- cially in remote regions. With so little information, it can be challenging to anticipate how well a wind turbine would function.
Machine learning models may not generalize effectively to other places with varied weather patterns after being trained on certain wind turbine locations and weather circumstances. The necessity to retrain models for different locales may be time- consuming and expensive, making it difficult to apply the same model to numerous geographic locations

#	Wind Theoretical Power Curve (KWh) Analysis
Often, the term "wind power traffic analysis" refers to the investigation of com- muting patterns and related infrastructure. The scales at which this research can be done range from specific wind farms to entire regions.
When applied to specific wind farms, traffic study may entail looking at the modes of transportation and methods employed to deliver supplies and equipment to the location. Large parts like wind turbine blades, tower sections, and nacelles may be transported using specialized trucks. The analysis may also take into account any potential modifications or repairs that may be required, as well as the effect of this transportation on nearby roads and bridges.
On a bigger scale, a wind power traffic analysis can look at the routes that are utilized to move materials and equipment for wind power across regions or nations. In order to handle the additional traffic brought on by the expansion of wind power, this may include using ships to move components across international borders or the construction of new transportation infrastructure, such as motorways or rail lines.
In general, wind power traffic analysis is a crucial component of wind power devel- opment because it can aid in identifying potential transportation issues and provide information on which solutions to develop to ensure the secure, effective, and sustain- able transportation of wind power materials and equipment.
# 	Wind Power analysis Technique
There are many different classification strategies for classifying wind power, how- ever the following techniques are the ones that are most frequently used: Machine learning (ML) approach. The output power of a wind turbine is dependent on wind direction in the wind direction technique. The wind turbine’s output power is at its peak when the wind is blowing at a 90-degree angle, and it steadily decreases as the wind direction changes. Trained classifiers are used as input in the ML (Machine Learning) approach for classifying wind power based on the data set. We are using the ML approach in our suggested system to analyze the wind power effectively. These drawbacks of the following classification algorithms are solved by ML-technique, which classifies data sets more effectively.
Machine learning is used for dynamic analysis for power and uses different param- eter for power calculation. It has two techniques for classification- supervised and unsupervised. In Supervised technique there is a training data set as input to train the system model for the expected output but in unsupervised technique there is no training/known data set and it works based on the prior knowledge or the statistical information.
#	Feature Selection
The choice of features is a crucial step, after power analysis to detect system anomalies. It can be set to automatically select attributes from a data sample that are most relevant to a predictive modeling problem. It maps to exclude irrelevant or redundant attributes and specifically defines the most salient attributes to improve system performance[10]. In our proposed system, we are dealing with large amounts of data from the web, so feature selection should be made based on the following requirements
 •	This lessens the model’s complexity and makes it simpler to interpret the desired outcomes.
•	This allows the model to train faster on sample data because there are no redundant features.
•	This method also reduces the problem of over fitting by improving the general- ization of the model.
#	Selection Method
Wind turbines are machinery that transform wind power into electric power. A method for determining the variables or features that are most crucial to a model’s or system’s performance is called feature selection. The most crucial elements influencing the effectiveness and output of the turbine can be found via feature selection in the context of wind turbines.
One technique for choosing features for wind turbines is to use machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be trained using the historical data of the wind turbine, which includes variables like wind speed, wind direction, rotor speed, and power output. The machine learning system can then identify the most important variables that have an impact on the operation of the wind turbine.
Using physical models and simulations is another strategy for feature selection for wind turbines. These models are able to replicate the behavior of the wind turbine
under various circumstances and can pinpoint the key factors affecting its perfor- mance. The design and operation of the wind turbine can then be optimized using these variables.
Overall, feature selection can be a helpful strategy for enhancing wind turbine performance. Engineers and designers can decide how to best design and operate a turbine by determining the critical factors that influence the turbine’s output and efficiency. 
# 	Conclusion

An important use of machine learning is wind turbine power prediction, which forecasts how much electricity a wind turbine will produce in the future. This fore- cast can assist grid operators in balancing power supply and demand, improving the efficiency of wind farms, and lowering the price of energy generation.
A software called IBM Watson Studio ML offers resources for creating and im- plementing machine learning models. Based on historical information such as wind speed, temperature, and air density, these tools may be used to create models that forecast the power production of wind turbines.
The collection of high-quality data, prepossessing of the data to eliminate any outliers or missing values, selection of pertinent features, and selection of an effective machine learning algorithm are crucial steps in the development of an accurate wind turbine power forecast model. A test set of data should be used to evaluate the model, and it should be regularly monitored and updated as new data become available.
In conclusion, utilizing ML to anticipate wind turbine output has the potential to increase the effectiveness and consistency of renewable energy generation. An effective platform for creating and implementing machine learning models is offered by IBM Watson Studio ML.
